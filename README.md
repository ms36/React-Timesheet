# Timesheet-made-3-ways
Users are able to enter their hours in a timesheet for each week. Users will be able to pick their hours via a drop down list and have the option to save and submit those hours to a database.  

The "timesheet" version has a simple login and is more of a proof of concept

The "react-timesheet" and "ng-timesheet" have addition functionality.  
When the user saves their timesheet, not only does it save it in the database, but creates an excel spreadsheet with the same data as well.  
Also, when the user submits a timesheet, it takes the excel spreadsheet, puts it in an email and sends it to payroll.
